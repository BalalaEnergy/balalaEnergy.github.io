分别与他们需要的接口建立依赖关系。也就是采用接口隔离原则\n接口 Interface1 中出现的方法，根据实际情况拆分为三个接口\n\n遵守了接口隔离原则的代码：\npublic class Segregation1 {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // 使用一把\n        A a = new A();\n

c.depend4(new D());\n        c.depend5(new D());\n    }\n}\n\n// 接 口 1\ninterface Interface1 {\n    void operation1();\n}\n\n// 接 口 2\ninterface Interface2 {\n    void operation2();\n\n    void operation3();\n}\n\n// 接 口 3\ninterface Interface3 {\n    void operation4();\n\n    void operation5();\n}\n\n\nclass B implements Interface1, Interface2 {\n    public void operation1() {\n        System.out.println(\"B 实现了 operation1\");\n    }\n\n\n    public void operation2() {\n        System.out.println(\"B 实现了 operation2\");\n    }\n\n\n    public void operation3() {\n

public void operation4() {\n        System.out.println(\"D 实现了  operation4\");\n    }\n\n\n    public void operation5() {\n        System.out.println(\"D 实现了 operation5\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass A {\n    // A 类通过接口 Interface1,Interface2 依赖(使用) B 类，但是只会用到 1,2,3 方法\n    public void depend1(Interface1 i) {\n        i.operation1();\n    }\n\n    public void depend2(Interface2 i) {\n

   }\n}\n\n为什么遵守\n\n避免大接口被许多子类实现，造成耦合。降低了耦合，代码也变得好维护。\n小接口可以赋予特定的含义，使得代码更好理解（例如Comparable接口和Serialization接口一目了然）。\n减少没必要实现的冗余代码。\n\n"},"chapter0/依赖倒置原则.html":{"url":"chapter0/依赖倒置原则.html","title":"Dependence
